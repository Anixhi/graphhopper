# GraphHopper Route Planner Enhancement

### Project Activity 3 – Social Coding (Cisco NetAcad)

This project enhances the existing **GraphHopper Directions API** application from Lab 4.9.2.  
Our team upgraded the command-line tool into a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**-based route planner with **error handling**, **input validation**, and **unit options (miles/km)**.

## Project Overview

### Objectives

## Why We chose this project

We chose to enhance the existing GraphHopper application because it provides a
strong foundation for developing new features. Enhancing it allowed us to focus on improving the user
experience, interface, and overall reliability while gaining real-world experience in API integration and
collaborative software development.
